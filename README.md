# Stonehearth--Elders
Stonehearth Mod
Status: WIP

This is a whole new kingdom for Stonehearth. The elders are a conglomerate of dryads and oreads (forest and stone golems) 
with the task to restore the power and magic of nature.

This mod is still in an early work in progress status and so might be full of bugs and and unfinished things.
Eventhough, if you like a small preview feel free to test it out.

To see what's next check the [concept](https://github.com/JohnnyTendo/Stonehearth--Elders/blob/master/concept.md).
