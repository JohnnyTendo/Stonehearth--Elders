# **Ideas**
## town progression campaign
	- Campaign
		- Dialog: Town founding & the cause for your settlement
			- Quest: collect a named amount (maybe 1000) Spirit
			- Reward: Let the Sapling (town_standard) grow at cost of spirit (maybe 1000)
		- Dialog: you have to rebalance the forces of nature by building a Focus-Hearth
			- Quest: Search & destroy an enemy camp to loot the Focus
			- Reward: get a Spirit-Focus (Item for evolving hearth)
		- Dialog: Congratz & now activate it
			- Quest: Enpower the Focus with spirits
			- Reward: Hearth evolves
	- Banner should be a sapling that grows with progression
	- Camp_standards for different versions for expanded towns
	- (maybe the evolving hearth should be a magical rock) eg. /desktop/hearth_evolved_stone.qbcl
